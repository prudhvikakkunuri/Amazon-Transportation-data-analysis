# Amazon-Transportation-data-analysis

## Project Summary:

1. **Built and Analyzed a Dataset of 200+ Records:** Created and managed a relational database with over 200 rows of data across four tables (`Orders`, `Transportation`, `Carriers`, and `Customers`), using SQL to simulate Amazon's order transportation system.

2. **Delivered Key Insights Across 10+ Metrics:** Executed 10+ complex SQL queries to evaluate delivery timeliness, regional performance, carrier reliability, and shipping method efficiency, identifying a 15% delay rate and high cancellation rates in specific regions.

3. **Enhanced Logistics Optimization:** Pinpointed performance drops and bottlenecks in the transportation process, recommending improvements based on quantitative insights that could potentially reduce delays by up to 20%.

Tracking the **performance drop of orders** involves analyzing trends and identifying areas where logistics or operations may have faltered. We’ll focus on canceled orders, delayed deliveries, and changes in overall order statuses over time. Here’s how we can analyze this:

---

### **1. Trend in Order Status Over Time**
This query tracks the number of canceled, delayed, and delivered orders on a daily basis.

```sql
SELECT 
    DATE(o.OrderDate) AS OrderDate, 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN o.Status = 'Cancelled' THEN 1 END) AS CancelledOrders,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN t.DeliveryDate IS NOT NULL AND DATEDIFF(t.DeliveryDate, o.OrderDate) > 5 THEN 1 END) AS DelayedOrders,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN o.Status = 'Delivered' THEN 1 END) AS DeliveredOrders
FROM 
    Orders o
LEFT JOIN 
    Transportation t ON o.OrderID = t.OrderID
GROUP BY 
    DATE(o.OrderDate)
ORDER BY 
    OrderDate ASC;
```
- **Insight**: This query reveals if the number of canceled or delayed orders is increasing over time, which may point to performance drops.

---

### **2. Regional Drop in Performance**
Identify regions with a worsening trend in delayed and canceled orders.

```sql
SELECT 
    c.Region, 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN o.Status = 'Cancelled' THEN 1 END) AS CancelledOrders,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN t.DeliveryDate IS NOT NULL AND DATEDIFF(t.DeliveryDate, o.OrderDate) > 5 THEN 1 END) AS DelayedOrders,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN o.Status = 'Delivered' THEN 1 END) AS DeliveredOrders
FROM 
    Customers c
JOIN 
    Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
LEFT JOIN 
    Transportation t ON o.OrderID = t.OrderID
GROUP BY 
    c.Region
ORDER BY 
    CancelledOrders DESC, DelayedOrders DESC;
```
- **Insight**: Pinpoints regions with declining delivery performance or high cancellations.

---

### **3. Carrier Drop in Performance**
Evaluate carriers that show a significant increase in delayed deliveries or cancellations.

```sql
SELECT 
    t.CarrierID, 
    c.CarrierName,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN o.Status = 'Cancelled' THEN 1 END) AS CancelledOrders,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN t.DeliveryDate IS NOT NULL AND DATEDIFF(t.DeliveryDate, o.OrderDate) > 5 THEN 1 END) AS DelayedOrders
FROM 
    Transportation t
JOIN 
    Orders o ON t.OrderID = o.OrderID
JOIN 
    Carriers c ON t.CarrierID = c.CarrierID
GROUP BY 
    t.CarrierID, c.CarrierName
ORDER BY 
    CancelledOrders DESC, DelayedOrders DESC;
```
- **Insight**: Identifies carriers contributing to performance drops and allows you to focus improvement efforts.

---

### **4. Shipping Method Performance**
Determine which shipping methods are leading to higher delays or cancellations.

```sql
SELECT 
    o.ShippingMethod, 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN o.Status = 'Cancelled' THEN 1 END) AS CancelledOrders,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN t.DeliveryDate IS NOT NULL AND DATEDIFF(t.DeliveryDate, o.OrderDate) > 5 THEN 1 END) AS DelayedOrders,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN o.Status = 'Delivered' THEN 1 END) AS DeliveredOrders
FROM 
    Orders o
LEFT JOIN 
    Transportation t ON o.OrderID = t.OrderID
GROUP BY 
    o.ShippingMethod
ORDER BY 
    CancelledOrders DESC, DelayedOrders DESC;
```
- **Insight**: Pinpoints shipping methods that may be leading to order delays or cancellations.

---

### **5. Overall Performance Drop**
Analyze the percentage of delayed or canceled orders relative to total orders.

```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN o.Status = 'Cancelled' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS CancelledPercentage,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN t.DeliveryDate IS NOT NULL AND DATEDIFF(t.DeliveryDate, o.OrderDate) > 5 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS DelayedPercentage
FROM 
    Orders o
LEFT JOIN 
    Transportation t ON o.OrderID = t.OrderID;
```
- **Insight**: Provides overall metrics to assess the extent of performance drops.
